POTUS|643882408283086848|2015-09-15 20:21:43|When I took office, 800,000 Americans lost their jobs each month. Our businesses have now added 13.1 million jobs over 66 straight months.
POTUS|643882148315951104|2015-09-15 20:20:41|7 years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, setting off the worst financial crisis in decades. Here's how far we've come:
